## Traditional Hives:

### i) Log Hive

- *Disadvantages:*
  - Brood chamber cannot be separated from the honey chamber, leading to honey contamination with the brood.
  - Harvesting is tedious.
  - Frequent invasion by ants and pests, leading to absconding.
  - Limited insulation to temperature and humidity.
  - Increased disturbance of the colony during harvesting or maintenance.
  - Removal of combs for inspection is impossible.

### ii) Clay-pot Hive

- *Disadvantages:* (Similar to Log Hive)

## Modern Hives:

### - Top Bar Hives

- *Advantages:*
  - Lighter.
  - Easier harvesting of honey and wax left over.
  - **Mile defense.**
- *Disadvantages:*
  - Cannot be expanded. Harder to get a new colony.
  - Requires more skill and confidence by the beekeeper.
  - Higher possibility of cross-combining.
  - Easier to steal because it is light.
  - More time to reconstruct the combs and stock with honey.

### - Langstroth Hives

- *Advantages:*
  - High honey production.
  - Possible to extract honey without destroying the combs, leading to shorter harvesting intervals.
  - Foundation and frames (spindles) prevent cross-combining.
  - Fairly inexpensive.
  - Standard size of parts allows interchangeability.
  - Easy to find equipment and supplies.
  - Easier to inspect during maintenance.

**Note:** Langstroth hives are more common in commercial beekeeping.
