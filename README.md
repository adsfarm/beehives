Not commonly used by commercial bee keepers because they have the following disadvantages:
 - Brood chamber cannot be separated from the honey chamber, leading to honey contamination with the brood.
 - Harvesting is tedious.
 - Frequent invasion by ants and pests, leading to absconding.
 - Limited insulation to temperature and humidity.
 - Increased disturbance of the colony during harvesting or maintenance.
 - Removal of combs for inspection is impossible.
